🎵 Spotify Genre Classification using Machine Learning
Can we predict the genre of a song just from its audio features?
This project explores that question using a dataset of over 45,000 Spotify tracks with metadata and audio features.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle / SpotifyFeatures.csv
Each row includes:

Audio features: danceability, energy, valence, tempo, etc.

Metadata: track name, artist, genre, etc.

🧪 Problem Statement
Multi-class classification:
Predict the genre of a track based on numerical audio features.

⚙️ Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled inconsistent genre labels (’ vs ')

Dropped nulls and limited to top 8 genres

Feature Scaling

Used StandardScaler for normalization

Model Training

Trained RandomForestClassifier on scaled features

Evaluation

Accuracy: 53%

classification_report included for all genres

📊 Results
Genre	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Comedy	0.98	0.95	0.96
Soundtrack	0.85	0.88	0.86
Electronic	0.61	0.63	0.62
Pop	0.44	0.52	0.47
Indie	0.09	0.08	0.08

🧠 Key Learnings
Genre classification is harder than it sounds — especially with overlapping genre definitions.

Reducing class imbalance and label noise led to a 2x jump in accuracy.

Feature engineering is crucial; models are only as good as the data behind them.

🚀 Next Steps
Try XGBoost for better performance

Add lyrics or metadata for richer predictions

Deploy as a Streamlit/Flask app for genre prediction UI

📦 Run the Project
